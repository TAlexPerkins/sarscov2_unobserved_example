# simOutbreak

This is a translation of the **R** code written by:

  * Alex Perkins, taperkins@nd.edu
  * Sean Cavany, scavany@nd.edu
  * Sean Moore, smoore15@nd.edu
  * Anita Lerch, alerch2@nd.edu

into **C** by Sean Wu (slwu89@berkeley.edu), in the hopes that it is useful.

The package has a single exported function `simOutbreak`, which functions the same as the **R** version.
